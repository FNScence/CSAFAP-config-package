		"C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Counter-Strike Global Offensive\game\csgo\cfg"
		
STEP 2: Place the modified language file "platform_english.txt" in the resource folder at the following path:
		"C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Counter-Strike Global Offensive\game\csgo\resource"

STEP 3: Open the main config of this package "CSAFAP\MAIN.cfg" with an editor of your choise (e.g. notepad++).
		IMPORTANT: EDIT LINE 6 TO ENTER YOUR PLAYING SENSITIVITY. You can also change the 3 (+2) keybinds in the following lines.

STEP 4: Run the main config in-game. Either type "exec CSAFAP/main" directly into the console, ...
		... use the same line in a config you already use, or use launch option "+exec CSAFAP/MAIN".

		Simply typing this newly defined alias into the console will run the config.
		alias "afap" "exec CSAFAP/MAIN"

		Done!

============================ FAQ ============================	
Q1: Is this allowed on MM, PREMIER?
	> Yes! This config package works purely on in-game commands and which work under SV cheats 0, and a modified language text-file.

Q2: Is this allowed on Faceit?
	> Yes! It's allowed for your normal ranked PUGS.

Q3: How to calculate yaw/pitch values?
	> [X = a / (s * 0.022)];[ a...angle you need to move (in Â°); s...sensitivity, X...desired yaw/pitch value]

Q4: The radio tiles are empty. How to get the text working?
	> Make sure to place "platform_english.txt" in the correct folder and use the english language in-game.
	
Q5: Why do I stop running when using the jumpthrow binds?
	> Autostop configs interfer with (W-)JT binds. Make sure to use default movement (for JT),
	> or movement configs with default W-bind (for W-JT).

Q6: Why does my quickswitch (or whatever you bound Q to) not work anymore?
	> The instant window flash on Anubis overwrites the keybind of Q.
	> If you don't want to use it, search for it in MAIN.cfg (CTRL+F) and change/delete it.
	
Q7: How to uninstall the config package?
	> Simply overwrite the keybinds used by this config package (1, 3, N, H, J, K, space, Q, W, A, S, D)
	> and don't execute CSAFAP/MAIN anymore.
